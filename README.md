# Python Learning Exercises

This repo contains various learning material I have encountered so far as part of this journey. I have completed Python3 courses on Codecademy, LinkedIn Learning, A Cloud Guru, and several other self-taught videos.

I am currently following the course 100 Days of Code from Dr Angela Yu. 

The goal is to become proficient and land somewhere between intermediate and advanced, and contribute to Open Source Community.
